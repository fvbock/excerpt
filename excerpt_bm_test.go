Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

to run it:

checkout search-v2 branch

run the python backend:

src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ python py_services/senbetsu_server.py               Starting server. Listening on tcp://*:4242...                              Start serving.

index the qortex data: src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ go run scripts/index_entries.go -dbid=2 -orgid=5018d345558fbe46c4000001

and then run qortex and try to search something.

the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

	the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

	pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;) Here is the qortex branch

	The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

	This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

	The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

	This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

	I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

	pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

	I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

	to run it:

	the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

	pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

	and then run qortex and try to search something.

	This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

	I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

	pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

	I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

	checkout search-v2 branch

	run the python backend:

	and then run qortex and try to search something.

	the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

	I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

	to run it:

	checkout search-v2 branch

	run the python backend:

	src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ python py_services/senbetsu_server.py               Starting server. Listening on tcp://*:4242...                              Start serving.

	index the qortex data: src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ go run scripts/index_entries.go -dbid=2 -orgid=5018d345558fbe46c4000001

	and then run qortex and try to search something.

	the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

	pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

	Here is the qortex branch

	The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

	This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

	the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

	pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

	The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

	This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

	The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

	This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

	I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

	pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

	I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

	to run it:

	the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

	pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

	and then run qortex and try to search something.

Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

and then run qortex and try to search something.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

checkout search-v2 branch

run the python backend:

Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

to run it:

the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

and then run qortex and try to search something.

Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

to run it:

the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

and then run qortex and try to search something.

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

to run it:

checkout search-v2 branch

run the python backend:

src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ python py_services/senbetsu_server.py               Starting server. Listening on tcp://*:4242...                              Start serving.

index the qortex data: src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ go run scripts/index_entries.go -dbid=2 -orgid=5018d345558fbe46c4000001

and then run qortex and try to search something.

the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

Here is the qortex branch

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

to run it:

checkout search-v2 branch

run the python backend:

src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ python py_services/senbetsu_server.py               Starting server. Listening on tcp://*:4242...                              Start serving.

index the qortex data: src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ go run scripts/index_entries.go -dbid=2 -orgid=5018d345558fbe46c4000001

and then run qortex and try to search something.

the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

and then run qortex and try to search something.

the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

and then run qortex and try to search something.

the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;)

Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

This is alpha … ;) and i did not change the frontend… so right now entries come out more or less as expected but for private chats and files it only shows the _id and the filename.

I will work with @Aaron Liang to plan out the work that needs to get done with this frontend/backend wise but this is a first version.

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

to run it:

checkout search-v2 branch

run the python backend:

src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ python py_services/senbetsu_server.py               Starting server. Listening on tcp://*:4242...                              Start serving.

index the qortex data: src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ go run scripts/index_entries.go -dbid=2 -orgid=5018d345558fbe46c4000001

and then run qortex and try to search something.

the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;) Here is the qortex branch

pls check the senbetsu (the library) documentation and add TODOs where you find it lacking or unclear.

I will post more about this when we planned out the next steps…

to run it:

checkout search-v2 branch

run the python backend:

src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ python py_services/senbetsu_server.py               Starting server. Listening on tcp://*:4242...                              Start serving.

index the qortex data: src/github.com/theplant/senbetsu [senbetsu (master)] $ go run scripts/index_entries.go -dbid=2 -orgid=5018d345558fbe46c4000001

and then run qortex and try to search something.

the dbid=2 (redis db) can be changed here BUT is currently hardcoded in qortex. needs to be added to the org data/transients…

pls let me know what breaks/only “works on my machine” ;) Here is the qortex branch

The documentation is in the library. Just run godoc and check it out there.

	読売新聞 5月16日(木)14時53分配信

	葬儀で稼いだ所得を隠し、約１億１０００万円を脱税したとして、葬儀会社「紫音」（東京都渋谷区）と「ファミリー共済会」（同豊島区）、ファミリー社前代表で両社の実質的経営者、津田覚(さとる)氏（６２）が、法人税法違反容疑で東京国税局から東京地検に告発されていたことがわかった。

	代理人の弁護士は、両社とも既に修正申告したとしている。

	弁護士や関係者の話によると、紫音は警視庁管内の約４０の警察署から、ファミリー社は病院から、それぞれ遺体搬送の依頼を受けた上、遺族の依頼で葬儀を行っていた。ところが一部の葬儀について売り上げと経費の両方を除外して葬儀が行われなかったように装うなどして、２０１１年までの３年間に計約３億８０００万円の法人所得を隠した疑いが持たれている。

	隠した所得は、津田氏のマンションやブランド品の購入費、預金、飲食費などに充てられていたという。

	津田氏は、１９８０年代初頭にブームとなった、不良学生風の格好をさせた猫のキャラクター商品「なめ猫」のプロデューサーで、現在も「なめ猫」商品の企画・管理会社を経営している。取材に対し、弁護士を通じて「取引先や関係各位に多大な迷惑をかけ、反省している」とコメントした。「なめ猫」生みの親、１億１０００万円脱税容疑
